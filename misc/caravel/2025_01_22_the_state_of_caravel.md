# The State of Caravel: the First Look
Yuri Panchul, 2025.01.20

This text is a mix of my thoughts on using Caravel and Open Lane together with a report on my first attempt to do the following:

1. Setup on 5 platforms: three Linux distributions, Windows and MacOS.
2. Running RTL-to-GDSII flow for eFabless examples.
3. Running RTL and gate-level simulation for eFabless examples.
4. Working with chipIgnite demo / evaluation / development board.
5. Planning for the next steps: seminars with ASIC open-source tools in Mexico and Armenia.

Let's start by defining a specific area where Caravel can be useful.

## 1. Caravel as a tool to train balancing microarchitecture, area and timing

Before joining an electronic company, a student who aims to become an RTL engineer - should be trained in developing pipelined designs. Not just a traditional 5-stage pipelined CPU, but pipelined data processing used in networking chips, GPUs and ML accelerators.

Such training requires doing a lot of exercises using a Verilog simulator to learn the tricks of maximizing bandwidth. However, learning microarchitecture without developing intuition about static timing analysis does not make sense: the students have to synthesize their designs to make sure the pipeline does not break the timing.

This is usually done in FPGA labs, however FPGA timing and utilization are different from ASICs, so here is another option: using eFabless Caravel infrastructure on the top of the Open Lane ASIC RTL-to-GDSII toolchain.

## 2. The Usage Scenario

The presumed usage scenario is:

1. We get a group of students who do Verilog simulation exercises using systemverilog-homework exercises and FPGA labs using basics-graphics-music (BGM) repository.

2. At some point, the students create their own designs using the BGM framework that isolates the students from FPGA vendor-specific details. Once a student’s design works on an FPGA board, the student can transfer his board-independent modules into a modified Caravel infrastructure.

3. The group can pack 15-30 designs into one Caravel or Caravel-Mini, depending on the required area and the costs. Glue logic, together with a housekeeping RISC-V core, can activate only one design at a time.

4. Alternatively, instead of making individual designs, the student team can work on a larger project, such as a mid-range CPU core with caches and MMU. In this way, the students can learn how to cooperate in a setting similar to an industrial team.

5. While working on a Caravel-based project, a student may re-engineer his pipelines to meet area and timing budgets. Eventually, the whole group will do a tapeout and get their chip manufactured in a few months.

## 3. The Alternatives

The alternative to Open Lane is to use Synopsys or Cadence licenses, but they are not available to everybody.

The alternative to the Caravel harness is to use TinyTapeout. While Tiny Tapeout is web-based and is easier from the installation point of view, it offers less area and fewer GPIO pins for each project. TinyTapeout also does not have an easy option to connect the design to a RISC-V housekeeping core available in Caravel. Cost-wise, TinyTapeout is more affordable for an individual student: $50 per tile of ~1000 ASIC standard cells, up to 16 tiles per project, plus a $200 development board. However, TinyTapeout infrastructure does not allow a group of students to build a larger project.

## 4. The Evaluation

Let's evaluate how robust the combination of Caravel and Open Lane is to start such training.

### 4.1. Step 1. The capacity estimation

Caravel-Mini is four times smaller than full Caravel and is less expensive, $3.5K versus $10K. Since Tiny Tapeout uses Caravel Infrastructure and has 512 tiles, we can roughly estimate that full Caravel accommodates ~512K standard cells and Caravel-Mini accommodates ~128K standard cells. This makes Caravel ~2.5 times more cost-efficient area-wise than TinyTapeout, and Caravel-Mini ~1.8 times more cost-efficient area-wise than TinyTapeout. Which is expected, this is similar to the difference in wholesale versus retail.

Based on a rough estimation of 1:10 D-flip-flop and logic gates ratio in a typical ASIC design and a knowledge of industrial MIPS CPU cores in the past, we can guess that Caravel can accommodate a mid-range industrial CPU core such as MIPS 24K used in WiFi routers and capable of running Linux. Caravel-Mini can probably accommodate only microcontroller cores such as various MIPS 4K or Cortex M derivatives and their RISC-V equivalents. TinyTapeout, with its limits up to 16 tiles or ~16K standard cells, can be used only for simplified educational CPU cores such as schoolRISCV.

### 4.2. Step 2. Generating the baseline projects from the templates

This step is straightforward. I generated two GitHub repos from eFabless templates: 

* https://github.com/yuri-panchul/caravel_user_mini_experiment is generated from https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_mini

* https://github.com/yuri-panchul/caravel_user_project_experiment is generated https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project

This happened on December 23, 2024 using the latest version.

### 4.3. Step 3. Setup

I did the setup on 5 platforms: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Lubuntu 24.04 LTS, Simply Linux 10.4, Windows 11 with WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) Ubuntu and MacOS on Apple Silicon (Mac Mini 4).

#### 4.3.1. Setup on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

First, three dependencies were missing: make, python3-pip and docker. I installed the first two using apt-get and docker using the instruction from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu. However it was not sufficient; I also had to use systemctl and gpasswd commands. Finally, I had to install a Python virtual environment using “sudo apt install python3.12-venv”. After this, “make setup” worked.

See *Appendix A.1. Ubuntu setup commands* for more details.

#### 4.3.2. Setup on Lubuntu 24.04 LTS

Setup on Lubuntu was similar to Ubuntu, I don't remember the difference, but maybe there were less bumps. See *Appendix A.2. Commands used to setup under Lubuntu 24.04 LTS* for more details.

#### 4.3.3. Setup on Simply Linux 10.4

Setup on Simply Linux did not ask for Docker or virtual environments, but this was probably due to the fact that I already had Open Lane up and running on my Simply Linux installation which was prepared by Anton Midyukov, a maintainer of Simply Linux distribution.

On one of Simply Linux systems I had to install *pyyaml*:

```bash
sudo apt-get install pip
python3 -m pip install pyyaml
```

#### 4.3.4. Setup on MacOS Sequoia 15.2, Apple Silicon, Mac Mini 4

This setup was relatively smooth: I had to install Docker following internet instructions for Docker for Mac, clone repositories and run ‘make setup’. The only bump was I had to install Python’s click package in a virtual environment:

```bash
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/yuri-panchul/caravel_user_mini_experiment
cd caravel_user_mini_experiment
make setup
# Failure

source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install click
make setup

# Success
```

#### 4.3.5. Setup on Windows 11 with WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) Ubuntu

Similarly to MacOS, I had to install Docker following internet instructions for Docker for Windows, then install a specific version of Python and Python’s click package in a virtual environment:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install click
```

Unlike stand-alone Ubuntu and MacOS, WSL Ubuntu under Windows 11 does not require to activate the virtual environment explicitly, at least I don't see such activation in my log. This is a strange inconsistency.

#### 4.3.6. The setup bottom line

It is still unclear to me why Open Lane and Caravel need Docker. All this software is just a set of file-to-file conversion programs, albeit sophisticated. They don’t use networking, drivers for exotic devices or some special services from the operating system. Xilinx Vivado, Altera Quartus, Gowin IDE - none of this software needs Docker. For me, Docker is just an additional hassle when installing a system of this kind.

First, I thought Docker was needed to fix the Python versioning. I am aware that Python has chaos in versioning so I do understand the need for Python virtual environments. But what is the need to have both Docker and Python virtual environments?

In any case, as we can see, even Docker does not save from installation bumps like “click” package here and there.

### 4.4. Step 4. Running RTL-to-GDSII flow for the included example

#### 4.4.1. Running RTL-to-GDSII flow for the example included in Caravel-Mini

```bash
make user_project_wrapper_mini
```

This command was successfully completed on all platforms: Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Simply, MacOS and Windows WSL.

It generated a GDSII file together with the reports, which are sufficient to train the students in tuning their microarchitecture against the area and timing budgets:

1. **1-synthesis.AREA_0.stat.rpt** - area report.
2. **33-rcx_sta.summary.rpt** - slack and other Static Timing Analysis (STA) summary.
3. **33-rcx_sta.max.rpt** - timing path details / setup.
4. **33-rcx_sta.min.rpt** - timing path details / hold.
5. **33-rcx_sta.power.rpt** - power estimation (not sure how it estimates switching power though).

However, I found that STA reports on different platforms differ. While this difference may not be significant or might be caused by some Open Lane checkin between the installations, it should be investigated. It might be an artifact of some Python or C sort function or a real bug, but whatever it is, it would be better from the user's perspective to make the results on all platforms identical.

Specifically, *33-rcx_sta.max.rpt* and *33-rcx_sta.min.rpt* reports generated on MacOS differ from the same reports generated on Lubuntu:

![tkdiff STA reports for Caravel-Mini between Lubuntu and MacOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/refs/heads/main/misc/caravel/2_tkdiff_hold_sta.png)

#### 4.4.2. Running RTL-to-GDSII flow for the example included in regular (not Mini) Caravel

```bash
make user_project_wrapper
```

This command was completed successfully on the first try on Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows WSL. However I was not able to find the area report, which is a critical issue.

Two runs on Lubuntu were not successful, but this was probably due to external factors:

1. Run low on disk space - see for details *Appendix C.1. Log for unsuccessful run 'make user_project_wrapper' under Lubuntu LTS 24.04*. It was not clear from the error message that the disk space is an issue.

2. Run low on memory - the command hangs on a computer with 4 gigabytes of RAM after step 25.

The third try, on a computer with 8 GB of memory, was successful. This means that Open Lane / Caravel infrastructure cannot gracefully detect and report insufficient resource conditions with a meaningful error message.

Run on Simply Linux 10.4 failed - see for details *Appendix C.2. Log 1 for an unsuccessful run 'make user_project_wrapper' under Simply Linux 10.4*, and *Appendix C.3. Log 2 for an unsuccessful run 'make user_project_wrapper' under Simply Linux 10.4*.

### 4.5. Step 5. Verification

#### 4.5.1. Caravel and cocotb

I did not dig into the details of Caravel verification, but it generally relies on cocotb, a Python-based solution that tries to mimic SystemVerilog (randomization, coverage) and UVM (an OOP library to structure a testbench) using Python.

While cocotb has an enthusiastic community of fans, I don't see it widely accepted in the electronic industry. I don't see electronic companies posting jobs with cocotb as a requirement, and I suspect the regression run time with cocotb might be too high for large projects. We already suffer in the industry with overnight regressions, but multiple day regressions might be too much. For this reason, I avoid using cocotb in education and keep SystemVerilog as the primary vehicle for verification as much as possible for free tools.

Icarus does not support randomization and coverage, but it does support fork, queues with $, and other SystemVerilog features that are sufficient to build reasonably sophisticated self-checking testbenches. So my approach with both Tiny Tapeout and Caravel would be to bypass cocotb: use it to drive the clock, start SystemVerilog actions and wait until SV is done. I prefer to drive the stimuli and do all the scoreboarding in SystemVerilog.

#### 4.5.2. Caravel and RISC-V

Tiny Tapeout uses MicroPython to control the user's design. Caravel has a housekeeping RISC-V core which a user can program in C. I did not dig deeper in Caravel verification but it looks like Caravel testbench allows to co-simulate software running on this core together with the user's Verilog design. I guess the same code can be used to control the design on chipIgnite demo board. If this is true, then Caravel allows a very useful form of teaching system design and software/hardware co-sumulation to the students. It can be added not only to the hardware design classes but also to embedded programming courses.

See for example the C code for a basic counter test `caravel_mini/verilog/dv/cocotb/counter_tests/counter_la/counter_la.c`:

```C
#include <common.h>
#include "../common/common.h"

void main(){
    // Enable managment gpio as output to use as indicator for finishing configuration
    mgmt_gpio_o_enable();
    mgmt_gpio_wr(0);
    enable_hk_spi(0); // disable housekeeping spi
    // configure all gpios as  user out then chenge gpios from 32 to 37 before loading this configurations
    configure_all_gpios(GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_OUT_MONITORED);
    configure_gpio(36, GPIO_MODE_MGMT_STD_INPUT_PULLDOWN);
    configure_gpio(37, GPIO_MODE_MGMT_STD_INPUT_PULLDOWN);
    gpio_config_load(); // load the configuration
    enable_user_interface();

    mgmt_gpio_wr(1); // configuration finished

    set_la_reg(0,7);
    set_la_oen(0,0xC0000000);
    set_la_oen(0,0xFFFFFFFF);

    return;
}
```

Now we have an issue with Simply Linux 10.4 which has a package for 64-bit RISC-V toolchain but does not have the 32-bit RISC-V toolchain package. In principle, I could build a 32-bit RISC-V toolchain from the source, but this would be a hassle.

#### 4.5.3. Verification results

Before running Caravel-Mini tests in Lubuntu, I did `make setup-cocotb`. This command run without problems.

##### 4.5.3.1. Caravel-Mini RTL verification results

Then I looked into `caravel_user_mini_experiment/verilog/dv/cocotb/counter_tests` directory, found several tests and run the following:

```bash
make cocotb-verify-counter_la-rtl       2>&1 | tee zzz_make_cocotb-verify-counter_la-rtl
make cocotb-verify-counter_la_clk-rtl   2>&1 | tee zzz_make_cocotb-verify-counter_la_clk
make cocotb-verify-counter_la_reset-rtl 2>&1 | tee zzz_make_cocotb-verify-counter_la_reset
make cocotb-verify-counter_wb-rtl       2>&1 | tee zzz_make_cocotb-verify-counter_wb
```

Everything failed. The failure logs are in *Appendix D.1. cocotb-based RTL verification run logs for Caraven-Mini on Lubuntu*. I got the same results running verification under other platforms.

##### 4.5.3.2. The regular Caravel RTL verification results

The regular Caravel RTL test run went better. One test ended in timeout, all other tests ran successfully:

```bash
make cocotb-verify-all-rtl 2>&1 | tee zzz_cocotb-verify-all-rtl
```

```

└──────────────────────┴────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┴────────────┴────────┴────────────┘
```

This result was also consistent for all platforms.

##### 4.5.3.3. The regular Caravel gate-level verification results

`make_cocotb-verify-all-gl` target was mentioned in Caravel documentation, specifically [https://github.com/yuri-panchul/caravel_user_project_experiment/blob/main/docs/source/index.md](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/caravel_user_project_experiment/blob/main/docs/source/index.md) but it failed with a compilation error.

TA data from a regular run rather than from make caravel-sta. However, I think if something does not work, it should be either debugged or removed from documentation.

For the details see *Appendix D.2. Error running cocotb-based gate-level verification for the regular Caravel.*

### 4.6. Step 6. Running other make targets

Since Caravel user project documentation, specifically [docs/source/index.md](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/caravel_user_project_experiment/blob/main/docs/source/index.md), mentioned other make targets, I ran them, but most runs resulted in errors. I don't need them for my purposes, for example I can get STA data from a regular run rather than from `make caravel-sta`. However I think if something does not work, it should be either debugged or removed from documentation.

#### 4.6.1. `make caravel-sta` does not like an array of instances in gate-level Verilog

Specifically right now `make caravel-sta` generates the following error message:

```
...
Error: /home/verilog/projects/caravel_user_project_experiment/caravel/verilog/gl/housekeeping.v line 155456, syntax error, unexpected '[', expecting '('
make[1]: *** [/home/verilog/projects/caravel_user_project_experiment/dependencies/timing-scripts/timing.mk:244: caravel-timing-typ-max] Error 1

make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/verilog/projects/caravel_user_project_experiment/dependencies/timing-scripts'
make: *** [Makefile:426: caravel-sta] Error 2
```

and the root cause is the following syntax:

```
...
  sky130_ef_sc_hd__decap_12 decap_12[1815:0] (.VGND(VGND),
    .VNB(VGND),
    .VPB(VPWR),
    .VPWR(VPWR));
```

#### 4.6.2. Other target errors

See the following logs:

1. Appendix E.1. Error on Lubuntu when running `make create-spef-mapping` for full Caravel
2. Appendix E.2. Error on Lubuntu when running `make extract-parasitics` for full Caravel
3. Appendix E.3. Error on MacOS when running `make extract-parasitics` for full Caravel

Note that the following scenario pass without issues for full Caravel:

4. MacOS, `make create-spef-mapping`
5. Windows WSL, both `make create-spef-mapping` and `make extract-parasitics`

### 4.7. Step 7. Working with chipIgnite demo / evaluation / development board

#### 4.7.1. Getting the board and soldering the header

I got a chipIgnite Demo Board for $120 from the [eFabless store](https://store.efabless.com/products/chipignite-demo-board). The board included a daughter card with a Caravel chip manufactured with a counter example.  The platform included a housekeeping RISC-V core with a Wishbone interface to the design, Logic Analyzer wires and GPIO.

I soldered headers to the board and made a [post on social media](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282395612354945025/) with the following video.

https://youtube.com/shorts/i3fwfOEqwTQ?si=ilHzPXiuD4drYarJ

#### 4.7.2. Getting the board documentation

Before doing any experiments I got the documentation called [Efabless Caravel “harness” SoC](https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). The document is a relatively easy read, it outlines the registers you can set in a C program running on a housekeeping RISC-V core. If you have ever worked with microcontrollers and used embedded ARM, MIPS or RISC-V toolchains, there is nothing unexpected here.

The fact that this board is programmable in C allows to add the exercises with this board to an embedded programming class. The students can try hardware-software interfaces at the barebone level.

#### 4.7.3. Running a precompiled test

You don't need to install the RISC-V toolchain to check the board is working. You can clone a GitHub repo [efabless/caravel_board](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board) and use the precompiled elf executables to run a blinking light example.

##### 4.7.3.1 Blinking light on Simply Linux

The commands in README.md file in the repo use incorrect path, probably they forgot to update the README.md file. However the following worked right away:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board.git
cd caravel_board/firmware/chipignite/blink
pip3 install pyftdi
make flash
```

`pyftdi` is a Python package that works with a chip from FTDI, Future Technology Devices International Limited, a well-known company in Scotland. eFabless uses this chip to program the housekeeping CPU on the board via a micro-USB cable coming from a PC.

##### 4.7.3.2 Blinking light on Ubuntu and Lubuntu

When I tried to run the same command on Ubuntu, I got the following error message:

```bash
pip3 install pyftdi
```

```
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try brew install
    xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew,
    use a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install xyz

    If you wish to install a Python application that isn't in Homebrew,
    it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. You can install pipx with

    brew install pipx

    You may restore the old behavior of pip by passing
    the '--break-system-packages' flag to pip, or by adding
    'break-system-packages = true' to your pip.conf file. The latter
    will permanently disable this error.

    If you disable this error, we STRONGLY recommend that you additionally
    pass the '--user' flag to pip, or set 'user = true' in your pip.conf
    file. Failure to do this can result in a broken Homebrew installation.

    Read more about this behavior here: <https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/>

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, b
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
```

I followed the instructions and the following sequence worked:

```bash
python3 -m venv my-venv
my-venv/bin/pip install pyftdi
source my-venv/bin/activate
make flash
```

##### 4.7.3.3 Unsuccessfull blinking light on Windows WSL

The most annoying thing for me when using virtual machines under Windows, is dealing with COM ports. It all started 10 years ago when I visited Moscow State University to run a seminar on behalf of the US MIPS Technologies / British Imagination Technologies. The local folks in Moscow decided to use some VM (I believe it was VirtualBox) to run Altera Quartus and upload the designs to FPGA boards using USB Blaster. It did not work on some machines and required additional manipulations periodically.

Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) is more robust but is also annoying. You have to start at least two terminals, Admin PowerShell and WSL, and perform the following Voodoo act. In Russia they call it "tanetz s bubnami" or "dance with tambourines", referring to a ritual performed by a shaman in Siberia.

This dance is well-documented by Microsoft in the instruction at [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb), but be aware that if you try to Google it, the search may direct you to some obsolete instructions for WSL 1 which do not work for the modern WSL 2. In Russia they call it "a Susanin act" referring to a Russian hero Ivan Susanin who confused Polish troops back 18th Century so they got drowned in the swamp instead of proceeding to the battlefield.

Just a couple of screenshots to illustrate the process:

`bind` in Windows Admin Power Shell:

![`bind` in Windows Admin Power Shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/refs/heads/main/misc/caravel/3_wsl_step_1_admin_power_shell_bind.png)

`attach` in Windows Power Shell (not necessarily Admin):

![`attach` in Windows Power Shell (not necessarily Admin)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/refs/heads/main/misc/caravel/4_wsl_step_2_power_shell_attach.png)

Finally we have it inside the WSL 2 virtual machine:

![Finally we have it inside WSL 2 virtual machine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/refs/heads/main/misc/caravel/5_wsl_step_3_ftdi_appears.png)

I was doing the same thing when I was running the Gowin FPGA toolchain under WSL and it worked well, however with the Caravel board, it did not. There was some incompatibility or a bug related to Python scripts:

![FTDI Python bug in Caravel script under Windows WSL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/refs/heads/main/misc/caravel/6_wsl_step_4_caravel_ftdi_script_bug.png)

Before running `make flash` I had to install *pyftdi*. Unlike regular Ubuntu it did not require a virtual environment under WSL Ubuntu:

```bash
pip install pyftdi
```

##### 4.7.3.4 Unsuccessfull blinking light on MacOS

On MacOS *pyftdi* required a virtual environment again:

```zsh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install pyftdi
```

Then I had the same bug as running `make flash` under Windows WSL. Apparently, neither Docker nor Python virtual environments remedy the situation:

```
(venv) yuri_panchul@Mac blink % make flash
python3 ../util/caravel_hkflash.py blink.hex
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/yuri_panchul/projects/caravel_board/firmware/chipignite/blink/../util/caravel_hkflash.py", line 22, in <module>
    with HKSpi(uart_enable_mode=HKSpi.UART_DISABLE) as hk:
         ~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

I need some Pythonian to explain to me why I need venv under Ubuntu and MacOS, but don't need it under Windows WSL Ubuntu and Simply Linux.

#### 4.7.4. Modifying the test, building it with RISC-V toolchain and running it on the board

The only platform I was able to go all the way was Ubuntu. I was able to install the RISC-V toolchain, modify the code of the `blink` example by changing the time interval, build it, upload to the board and see the blinking pattern changing. I guess Lubuntu should work as well, but I did not try Lubuntu.

All other platforms had issues. I had no problem installing the RISC-V toolchain under Windows WSL and MacOS but because of board programming script errors I could not test the results on the board.

To build and install RISC-V toolchain under Windows WSL I did the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 python3-pip python3-tomli libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev ninja-build git cmake libglib2.0-dev libslirp-dev
./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv
sudo make
```

The installation on WSL took time but there were no issues. I had to use `sudo make` to install the toolchain in `/opt` directory, but if you install it into `$HOME` you can probably do this without sudo.

Installing RISC-V toolchain on MacOS was also easy using an instruction from [https://github.com/riscv-software-src/homebrew-riscv](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/homebrew-riscv):

```zsh
brew tap riscv-software-src/riscv
brew install riscv-tools
```

Just as with WSL it took some significant time.

Simply Linux 10.4 distribution had only 64-bit RISC-V toolchain package while the Caravel board required 32-bit architecture support in the toolchain, i.e. `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -O0 -march=rv32i` or `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O0 -march=rv32i`. I could probably build the 32-bit toolchain on Simply Linux 10.4 by myself, but I will let the maintainers of Simply Linux / ALT Linux to handle it.

```
[verilog@host-15 blink]$ make clean flash
rm -f *.elf *.hex *.bin *.vvp *.vcd
#/usr/local/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -O0 -march=rv32i -Wl,-Bstatic,-T,../sections.lds,--strip-debug -ffreestanding -nostdlib -o blink.elf ../start.s ../print_io.c blink.c

## 5. The Next Steps

### 5.1. Hackathons in Mexico and Armenia

Why am I doing this independent evaluation? Because I want to integrate Tiny Tapeout and eFabless Caravel into [Verilog Meetups](https://verilog-meetup.com) in Silicon Valley as well as some coming international hackathons, one in Mexico on February 14-15 and another in Armenia on March 13-14. The general format is outlined in *Chapter 2. The Usage Scenario*, as well as in [Between Physics and Programming: a Workshop on a Hardware Description Language SystemVerilog used to design the silicon chips](https://verilog-meetup.com/2024/10/23/between-physics-and-programming).

For the event in Mexico we have a reasonably working variant of the Tiny Tapeout template, [https://github.com/yuri-panchul/tt10-verilog-template-for-verilog-meetup](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/tt10-verilog-template-for-verilog-meetup).

For the event in Armenia I want to prepare a template based on Caravel-Mini. The good news is that the basic flow is kind of working:

1. I can run RTL-to-GDSII on Lubuntu, get GDSII files, the area and timing reports. Open Lane is not as robust as Synopsys and Cadence, plus I read it has some issues with memory inferencing, but I can live with that.

2. I can install the RISC-V toolchain and build some custom C programs that control the design in Caravel-Mini SoC.

3. I can plug the board into a computer's USB port and program it with my executable.

I don't like how the RTL verification is organized but I can do this part outside the Caravel framework. The only thing I need to do urgently is to create some glue Verilog code to put all the student designs under one Caravel-Mini wrapper. In a similar way to Tiny Tapeout, but without hardening each student's design individually. Let them learn teamwork, just what we have in electronic companies.

After this exercise I can make 30 bootable SSDs with Lubuntu and our variant of Caravel-Mini infrastructure, get some Gowin FPGA boards for the first part of the hackathon, drive to San Francisco International, then fly to Yerevan, Armenia to test it as a pilot project. If the Verilog glue code part does not work for some reason, my fall-back plan is Tiny Tapeout.

### 5.2. Updating the materials

Based on the outcome of hackathons in Mexico and Armenia, we plan to solidify all the materials to clone this event in other places. There is interest in ASIC and FPGA in many other places, even Nepal, Kenya and Bangladesh.

Some examples of the previous materials:

1. [Slides from the Verilog Meetup in Los Angeles back in August 2024](https://bit.ly/Verilog-Meetup-in-LA-2024-08-31)

2. [Slides from a week-long seminar in Azerbaijan back in February 2024](https://bit.ly/ada-univ-sv-fpga-2024)

3. [Slides from a seminar in hardware AI accelerators in Moscow back in 2021](https://bit.ly/startupvillage2021panchul)

We plan to create videos in Mexico similar to the Verilog Meetup in LA but will all the practical training details. Here is a short promotional video from the seminar in LA:

## Appendix B.5. A fragment of **33-rcx_sta.power.rpt** report: power estimation

Leakage power is proportional to area, but it is not clear to me how Open Lane computes switching power without stimulus of some sort. Is it propagating some switching from I/O pins, or does it assume some default switching?
